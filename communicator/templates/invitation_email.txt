This is your invitation from the University of Virginia Be SAFE System.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To help keep our classes in-person, and to help keep our community safe, we are launching Be SAFE*
(Screening Asymptomatic Finding Effort). Be SAFE is a quick and easy coronavirus screening
program that will rely on saliva samples to detect the virus, with the goal of identifying silent
carriers before they have the opportunity to transmit the coronavirus. The saliva screenings are
mandatory and free of charge. The screenings will be done at multiple locations around Grounds and
only take about 2-3 minutes. The ultimate goal is to test all asymptomatic students who are coming
on Grounds periodically throughout the semester and to get them results within hours (rather than days).

Your next screening test is scheduled at:
