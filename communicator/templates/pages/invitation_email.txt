This is an important message from the University of Virginia


Dear Student,

As part of our shared effort to keep each other and the community safe, the University is conducting
asymptomatic prevalence testing
(https://news.virginia.edu/content/uva-expands-methods-student-testing-monitoring-presence-covid-19)
for all students who are living and learning on Grounds or in the Charlottesville/Albemarle area.  People can carry
the virus and transmit it even though they feel fine and have no symptoms of the disease.  Identifying people who have
COVID but are asymptomatic helps to minimize the spread of the virus.

============================================================
You have been selected for a salvia screening on {{date}}.
============================================================

Please read the following information carefully:

    1. Testing will take place at {{location}}. There are orange signs to direct you to the screening location.
    2. You should refrain from eating, drinking, brushing your teeth, using mouth wash, chewing gum, or using tobacco
       for at least one hour before submitting your saliva sample at the screening location.
    3. You need to bring your university ID card.
    4. You can come at any time during testing times listed above. The entire screening procedure should take less than
       10 minutes.
    5. Screening is mandatory.  If you are unable to go to the screening times listed above due to an
       unavoidable conflict (such as class), please email prevalence-test@virginia.edu to reschedule.

Outcomes will be available within 24 hours.  You will receive an email (and a text if you have provided a
cell number in SIS) with a link to follow for negative results.  Students with positive results will be
contacted by Student Health and Wellness.

Students with positive test results will need to isolate and participate in contact tracing.   If you test
positive, your name and health status will be disclosed confidentially to the Office of the Dean of
Students (ODOS). If you live in University housing, ODOS will work with Housing and Residence Life to
facilitate assignment of isolation housing for you, if/as needed. Regardless of where you live, ODOS will
also offer you general support and assistance.</span></li>

(SDAC) https://studenthealth.virginia.edu/sdac via email (sdac@virginia.edu) or phone (434-243-5180) to

Important note: students will not be subject to disciplinary action for a positive test result or for any
information disclosed as part of contact tracing.  Testing and contact tracing are some of our most effective
tools against the virus. Â Your full participation will help protect you, your friends, and your community.
Thank you for doing your part.
